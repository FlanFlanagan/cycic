Overview
========
Cycic (pronounced 'psychic') is a fuel cycle input generator.  This tool is closely 
coupled to the data model of the discrete time nuclear fuel cycle code `cyclus`_.  
Currently, cycic is implemented in pure JavaScript and is accessible from any 
modern web browser.  This leverages a number of excellent libraries, such as `jQuery`_
and `d3`_ for building interfaces and graphs.

Cycic's design is broken up into two fundamental parts: the user-facing views and
the backend model.  Previous incarnations of cycic were called `bright.ui`_ and were
written in Python using - at various times - `VisTrails`_ and the 
`Enthought Tool Suite`_.

Models
------
Cyclus uses `RelaxNG`_ (RNG) to create and validate fuel cycle components
and the simulation as a whole.  Cyclus has a `multi-tiered modeling paradigm`_,
including facilities, markets, regions, and institutions.  Abstract schemas for 
each of these types of models are provided through associated RNG files to the 
underlying C++ code.  

The cycic tool takes these RNG schema files and converts them to a JSON object 
representing the same information.  These in-memory JSON objects are then used 
to generate facility, market, region, or institution specific forms for creating 
instances of these models.  Once a new instance is created by the user, it 
is stored in a simulation object.  These simulation objects may be presisted either 
as JSON objects themselves or converted to XML.  This XML representation is 
valid input for the cyclus itself.  See Figure 1 for a graphical display of 
this process.
